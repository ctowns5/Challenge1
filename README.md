# <Module 1 Challenge>

## Description

This project was the first graded assignment I am submitting for my coding bootcamp. It is basically a refactoring of an existing web page.

Here are the basics of the assignment

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```md

```
To complete this assignment I replaced the many divs in the index.html with the semantic elements nav, main, section, and footer

the title was changed from webpage to Horiseon Home

the style.css was edited to work with the html changes, comments were added and several sections were consolidated.
